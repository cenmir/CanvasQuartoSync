"""Derive one assignment's grade from several others.

A student records system usually wants **one** result per examination module,
while teaching wants **several** assignments that are examined separately. The
Swedish system LADOK is the case this was written for: its "Laboration 3 hp"
module maps to a single Canvas column, but the course runs five labs that
students demonstrate one at a time, on their own schedule.

A *rollup* closes that gap. One assignment is declared to be the roll-up of
several others, and this module works out which students have satisfied the
requirement and marks the roll-up assignment for them. Nothing else is graded,
and nothing is ever taken away.

The rule lives in the **target's own frontmatter**, so it sits next to the
assignment it governs and travels with it through a rename::

    ---
    title: "Laboration"
    canvas:
      type: assignment
      grading_type: pass_fail
      rollup:
        requires:
          - 01_Dragprovning.qmd
          - 02_Balklosare.qmd
        pass_at: 1
    ---

Paths in ``requires`` are relative to the declaring file, the same way links in
the body are. There is no central registry: a course may declare as many
rollups as it likes, each in its own target file, and :func:`discover_rollups`
finds them by reading frontmatter.

Nothing here writes to Canvas except :func:`apply_rollup`, and the caller has
to ask for that explicitly.

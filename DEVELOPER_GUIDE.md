# Developer Guide — Canvas Quarto Sync

> **Purpose of this file**: Give any new contributor (human or AI) a fast, authoritative overview of the project so they can orient themselves and contribute safely.

---

## What This Project Does

**Canvas Quarto Sync** is a Python CLI tool that synchronizes a local folder of [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) content (`.qmd` files, JSON quizzes, PDFs, images, calendar YAML) to an [Instructure Canvas](https://www.instructure.com/) LMS course.

The user manages their entire course as a **local code repository** (Git). Running `sync_to_canvas.py` walks the directory tree, renders Quarto to HTML, and creates/updates Pages, Assignments, Quizzes, Module Items, and Calendar Events in Canvas via the REST API.

## Architecture Overview

### Sync Pipeline

```
sync_to_canvas.py
  │
  ├── Parse CLI args (content_root, --course-id, --sync-calendar, --force, --check-drift, --only, --verbose, --quiet, --log-file)
  ├── Initialize logging (handlers/log.py → setup_logging())
  ├── Load Canvas API via canvasapi library
  ├── Walk content_root for NN_* folders (→ Modules) and NN_* files
  │
  └── For each file:
        ├── Handler chain: PageHandler → AssignmentHandler → QuizHandler
        │                  → SubHeaderHandler → CalendarHandler
        ├── First handler where can_handle() returns True wins
        └── handler.sync() does rendering + API create/update
```

### Handler Pattern

All handlers inherit `BaseHandler` (ABC):

| Method | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `can_handle(file_path)` | Return `True` if this handler owns the file (checks extension + frontmatter `canvas.type`) |
| `sync(file_path, course, module, ...)` | Render → upload → create/update Canvas object → add to module |
| `add_to_module(module, item_dict, indent)` | Shared logic: find existing module item or create new, sync title/indent/published |

### Key Shared Utilities (`content_utils.py`)

| Function | What it does |
|---|---|
| `process_content()` | Scans HTML/Markdown for images and links; uploads assets, resolves cross-links |
| `upload_file()` | Uploads a file to Canvas with smart caching (skips if `mtime` unchanged) |
| `resolve_cross_link()` | Resolves `[text](other.qmd)` → Canvas URL; creates stubs (JIT) for unsynced targets |
| `prune_orphaned_assets()` | Deletes files in `synced-images`/`synced-files` that are no longer referenced |
| `load_sync_map()` / `save_sync_map()` | Persist `.canvas_sync_map.json` (maps local path → Canvas ID + mtime) |
| `safe_delete_file/dir()` | Retry-with-backoff deletion (Dropbox/OneDrive lock workaround) |

### Dates (`dates.py`)

Every handler funnels its date fields through one normaliser, so all APIs receive
the same thing: a UTC string.

| Function | What it does |
|---|---|
| `to_canvas_iso(value, tz, field)` | The workhorse. `None`/`''` → `''` (clears the field in Canvas); a value already carrying `Z` or an offset is returned unchanged; a naive value — string, or the `datetime`/`date` PyYAML builds from unquoted frontmatter — is read in `tz` and converted to UTC |
| `resolve_timezone(course, content_root)` | `config.toml` `timezone` first, else the Canvas course's `time_zone`. Cached; warns once when the two disagree |
| `dst_anomaly()` / `naive_local()` | Classify a local time as `"gap"` (never happens) or `"ambiguous"` (happens twice); used by the validator |
| `parse_canvas_utc()` / `to_local_naive()` | Read Canvas's UTC back — for comparing instants (calendar dedup) and for the import direction |

Two properties worth preserving when touching this:

- **It always returns a `str`.** The New Quizzes endpoint is JSON, so a `datetime`
  reaching `json.dumps` aborts the sync. Returning a string makes that unrepresentable.
- **Explicit offsets pass through untouched**, so adopting this was not a content
  migration — every pre-existing `...Z` file kept its exact meaning.

Timezone resolution is *lazy*: a course whose dates all carry `Z` never needs one
configured. `tzdata` is a hard requirement on Windows, which ships no tz database.

---

## Naming Conventions

- **Modules**: Directories named `NN_Name` (e.g., `01_Introduction`). The `NN_` prefix sets order and is stripped for Canvas display.
- **Content files**: `NN_Name.ext` inside module dirs. Prefix determines module order; stripped from Canvas titles.
- **Non-prefixed files/dirs**: Ignored by the sync tool (e.g., `graphics/`, `handlers/`).

---

## Content Types & Detection

| Extension | Frontmatter `canvas.type` | Handler | Canvas Object |
|---|---|---|---|
| `.qmd` | `study_guide` | `StudyGuideHandler` | Wiki Page + PDF File (dual output) |
| `.qmd` | `page` | `PageHandler` | Wiki Page |
| `.qmd` | `assignment` | `AssignmentHandler` | Assignment |
| `.qmd` | `subheader` | `SubHeaderHandler` | Module Text Header |
| `.qmd` | `external_url` | `ExternalLinkHandler` | Module External URL |
| `.qmd` | `new_quiz` | `NewQuizHandler` | Quiz (New Quizzes) |
| `.qmd` | *(contains `:::: {.question` blocks)* | `QuizHandler` | Quiz (Classic) |
| `.json` | *(has `quiz_engine: new`)* | `NewQuizHandler` | Quiz (New Quizzes) |
| `.json` | *(structural check)* | `QuizHandler` | Quiz (Classic) |
| `.pdf`, `.zip`, etc. | N/A | Solo file logic in `sync_to_canvas.py` | Uploaded File + Module Item |
| `schedule.yaml` | N/A | `CalendarHandler` | Calendar Events |

---

## Smart Sync (mtime-based Skipping)

Each handler checks the file's `mtime` against the value stored in `.canvas_sync_map.json`. If unchanged → skip Quarto render and Canvas API update. Always runs `process_content()` to track `ACTIVE_ASSET_IDS` for pruning.

---

## Dependencies

All Python dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt` at the project root. The project uses a **virtual environment** managed with "uv".

**Quick setup** (Windows): `irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cenmir/CanvasQuartoSync/main/install.ps1 | iex`

**Manual setup**: activate the venv and install:

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
# source .venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```
canvasapi          # Canvas REST API wrapper
requests           # Raw HTTP client for New Quizzes API
python-frontmatter # YAML frontmatter parser
PyYAML             # YAML parsing (calendar, quiz metadata)
asteval            # Safe math evaluation for Formula questions
rich               # Colored console output and pretty tracebacks
quarto             # External CLI — must be in PATH
```

---

## Testing

The project has a full test suite in `tests/`. **Always run the tests before and after making changes** to verify nothing is broken.

```powershell
# Run all fast tests (unit + integration, no external deps)
.venv\Scripts\python -m pytest tests/unit/ tests/integration/ -v

# Run a single test file
.venv\Scripts\python -m pytest tests/unit/test_qmd_quiz_parser.py -v

# Run E2E tests against a real Canvas test course
.venv\Scripts\python -m pytest tests/e2e/ -v -m canvas --course-id 12345
```

E2E credentials, course id, and a safety marker can be stored once in a gitignored `./.e2e/config.toml` (copy `tests/e2e/e2e.config.example.toml`) instead of passing them each run — resolution reuses `handlers/config.py`. The target course is purged and re-synced fresh each run, guarded by a course-name marker (`test_course_marker`) so a non-test course is never wiped. Shared logic lives in `tests/e2e/canvas_helpers.py`.

See `TESTING.md` for the full guide including how to set up E2E credentials.

### Test tiers

| Tier | Location | Requires | Speed |
|------|----------|----------|-------|
| Unit | `tests/unit/` | Nothing | < 1 s |
| Integration | `tests/integration/` | Nothing (mocked Canvas API) | < 1 s |
| E2E | `tests/e2e/` | Canvas credentials + Quarto CLI | Minutes |

### Writing tests for new functionality

**Every new feature or bug fix must be accompanied by tests.** This is the primary way to ensure changes do not break existing functionality.

- **New content type / handler** → add `can_handle()` tests in `tests/unit/test_handler_detection.py` and a sync integration test in `tests/integration/`. Add at least one representative content file to `tests/fixtures/e2e_content/` and a corresponding assertion in `tests/e2e/test_full_sync.py`.
- **New parser logic** (quiz format, preprocessor, etc.) → add unit tests directly in a `tests/unit/test_<module>.py` file covering the happy path plus edge cases.
- **New content utility** (upload logic, cross-linking, etc.) → add unit tests in `tests/unit/test_content_utils.py` and, if Canvas API interaction is involved, a mocked integration test.
- **New `canvas.*` setting** → update `CANVAS_SCHEMA` in `validate_content.py` plus both docs (see "Adding or renaming a `canvas.*` setting" below); `tests/unit/test_doc_consistency.py` enforces this.
- **Bug fix** → add a test that reproduces the bug first, then fix it. This prevents regressions.

Follow the **Arrange / Act / Assert** pattern (see `TESTING.md`). Group related tests in a class and use descriptive names (`test_rejects_missing_prefix`, not `test_case_3`).

---

## Common Tasks for AI Assistants

### Adding a new content type
1. Create a new handler class inheriting `BaseHandler`.
2. Implement `can_handle()` and `sync()`.
3. Register the handler in `sync_to_canvas.py`'s handler chain.
4. Add `can_handle()` tests to `tests/unit/test_handler_detection.py`.
5. Add a representative content file to `tests/fixtures/e2e_content/`.
6. Add E2E assertions to `tests/e2e/test_full_sync.py`.

### Syncing a single asset

A single content file can be synced without walking the whole course, via the
`--only <relpath>` CLI flag **or** programmatically (e.g. from a future GUI).

- **Reusable entry point**: `handlers/single_sync.py → sync_single_file(course, content_root, target_abs_path, canvas=None, handlers=None)`. It returns a `SingleSyncResult` dataclass (`success`, `message`, `module_item`, `position`) — no log parsing required.
- **Same handlers as full sync**: both paths build the handler chain via `build_handlers()` and find/create modules via `find_or_create_module()` (both in `single_sync.py`), so behavior is identical to a full sync. The handler still writes the sync map (`save_mapped_id`), so a later full sync recognizes the item.
- **Correct placement**: after syncing, `compute_insert_position()` determines the item's slot by counting the syncable sibling files (sorted filename order) that sort before it **and** are already present as module items. It matches files to module items by title via `content_utils.expected_canvas_title()` (a render-free title computation that mirrors the per-handler title rule).
- The CLI `--only` branch in `sync_to_canvas.py` simply resolves the path and delegates to `sync_single_file()`.

When adding a new content type, no extra work is needed for single-asset sync as long as the handler follows the standard pattern (returns its module item from `sync()` and updates the sync map). If the handler derives its title differently, update `expected_canvas_title()` to match.

### Adding or renaming a `canvas.*` setting

Settings are documented in two places on purpose (the kit is what AI assistants read;
the user guide is what humans read), with a machine-readable schema keeping them honest.
Update **three** places, or `tests/unit/test_doc_consistency.py` will fail:

1. `validate_content.py` → `CANVAS_SCHEMA` (the source of truth for names and value types)
2. `content_kit/skills/canvas-content/reference/frontmatter.md` → a table row
3. `Guides/Canvas_Sync_User_Guide.md` → wherever that content type is described

The test asserts the schema and both documents describe exactly the same set of keys,
in both directions — so a setting can't ship undocumented, and the docs can't describe
a setting the tool doesn't support.

### The content authoring kit

`content_kit/` is the source; `init_content_project.py` copies it into a content folder
and stamps machine-specific paths into the wrappers. Notes for maintainers:

- Paths come from `sys.executable` and `__file__`, never a hardcoded `.venv` — the
  installer puts the venv in `~/venvs/canvas_quarto_env`, outside the repo.
- The skill directory is replaced wholesale on `--update` (tool-owned), while
  `config.toml`, course content, and an edited `CLAUDE.md` are left alone.
- `kit_status()` powers the stale-kit notice in `sync_to_canvas.py`; it must stay
  advisory and never raise.
- The kit tells assistants **never to run the sync scripts**. Preserve that when
  editing `SKILL.md` or `CLAUDE.md.template`.

### Modifying Quarto rendering
- The render pipeline is in `PageHandler.sync()` and `AssignmentHandler.sync()` (duplicated — see Improvements).
- Pattern: write temp `.qmd` → `quarto render --to html` → extract `<main>` content → cleanup temp files.

### Working with quizzes
- JSON format: parsed directly in `QuizHandler.sync()`.
- QMD format: parsed by `qmd_quiz_parser.py → parse_qmd_quiz()`, then rendered via `_render_qmd_questions()` batch Quarto call.
- Both formats support the same Canvas quiz settings.
- **Deduplication matching logic**: Canvas questions do not have a client-assigned ID. To match a local question with an existing Canvas question (and gracefully recover missing caches without duplicating), handlers pull all questions from Canvas, map them by `question_name` into arrays. As local questions are synced, they pop from the list. What's left over gets aggressively deleted from Canvas.

### Debugging sync issues
- Check `.canvas_sync_map.json` in the content root for ID mappings.
- Delete the map entry for a file to force re-render on next sync.
- Use `--verbose` (`-v`) to see DEBUG-level output with timestamps and log levels.
- Use `--log-file sync.log` to capture full debug output to a file.
- All output uses Python's `logging` module via the shared `logger` from `handlers/log.py`.

## How We Track Work

**Use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/JonssonLogic/CanvasQuartoSync/issues).**
They are the record, not a file in the repo.

This used to be `BUGS_AND_IMPROVEMENTS.md`, and it stopped working once the repo
had more than one maintainer. A shared to-do file conflicts on every merge,
completed items accumulate as strikethrough because a file cannot close
anything, and a pull request has no way to say which entry it addresses.

| What | Where |
|:---|:---|
| A bug, with a reproduction | issue |
| A feature or change someone could pick up | issue |
| A design question needing a decision | issue, before writing code |
| A Canvas limitation nothing can fix | `BUGS_AND_IMPROVEMENTS.md` |
| Why a past decision was made | `LESSONS_LEARNED.md` |
| Half-formed, not yet worth anyone else reading | your own notes |

Not everything belongs in an issue. Something you are still thinking about is
better in a scratch file than as a backlog entry nobody can act on.

### Working on something

- **Branch from `main`**, one concern per branch. A branch that grows past what
  its name says should be split.
- **Reference the issue** in the pull request body. `Fixes #12` closes it on
  merge; plain `#12` just links.
- **A bug fix comes with a test that fails without it.** Easiest way to be sure:
  stash only the fix, run the test, watch it fail, unstash.
- **Verify against a real course** when the claim is about Canvas behaviour.
  Canvas rewrites HTML on save, and assumptions about it are usually wrong.
- **Name the judgement call.** If a change involved a decision that could
  reasonably have gone the other way, say so in the pull request rather than
  deciding it silently. It is what makes a review possible.

### Two kinds of change, two kinds of pull request

**Bug fixes** can go straight to a pull request. The reproduction is the argument.

**Anything that changes behaviour for existing users** starts as an issue.
Defaults, file formats, exit codes, and command-line semantics all fall here.
Agreeing the shape first is cheaper than agreeing it inside a diff.

---

## Important Notes

- **Work is tracked in GitHub issues**, not in a file. See *How We Track Work* above.
- **Read `LESSONS_LEARNED.md`** for Canvas API quirks and design rationale. This file captures things a contributor still needs to be aware of (API limitations, non-obvious design choices, gotchas). Once an issue or limitation is resolved, its entry can be removed.
- **Read `Guides/Canvas_Sync_User_Guide.md`** for the full user-facing feature documentation.
- All dates in Canvas API use ISO 8601 format. Empty string `''` clears a date field; `None` is ignored.
- The Canvas API ignores `published` during module item creation — a separate `.edit()` call is required.

---

## VS Code Extension

The `extension/` directory contains a VS Code extension that wraps the Python tools with a GUI. See `extension/devInstructions.md` for build and debug instructions.

### How it works

The extension has two parts:

- **Extension host** (`src/`): Node.js code that uses the VS Code API. Spawns the Python scripts, manages the sidebar, status bar toggles, and webview panels.
- **Webview** (`webview/`): A React app running in a sandboxed iframe inside VS Code. Handles the QMD preview rendering (remark/rehype pipeline, KaTeX, Mermaid, syntax highlighting) and inline commenting.

### Extension commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| Sync to Canvas | Opens a menu with Sync All / Sync Current File + toggle flags |
| Sync This File | Syncs a single .qmd file (right-click or editor title icon) |
| Import from Canvas | Runs `import_from_canvas.py` with scope picker |
| Diff with Canvas | Runs `sync_to_canvas.py --check-drift --show-diff` |
| Purge Canvas Course | Runs `purge_course.py` with confirmation (must type course name) |
| New Project | Opens a full-page form to scaffold a new course |
| Open Preview | Opens a side-by-side QMD preview matching Canvas styling |

### Preview rendering pipeline

The preview ports MDViewer's rendering pipeline (from `github.com/JonssonLogic/MDViewer`):

1. `qmdPreprocess.ts` strips YAML, converts fenced divs, tabsets, shortcodes, cross-refs
2. `remarkCallouts.ts` transforms `:::note` directives into callout divs
3. `react-markdown` with remark-gfm, remark-math, remark-directive, rehype-katex, rehype-highlight, rehype-slug, rehype-raw
4. Custom components: CodeBlock (language badge + copy), MermaidBlock (diagram rendering), TabsetBlock (interactive tabs)
5. CSS matches Canvas branding colors from `base_handler.py`

### Commenting system

Comments are stored as an HTML comment block at the end of the `.qmd` file. The format is defined in `commentParser.ts`. Comments are invisible to Canvas sync because HTML comments are stripped during rendering. The extension highlights commented text in the preview via DOM manipulation after React renders.

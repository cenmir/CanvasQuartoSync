## Canvas API Limitations

### Quiz Snapshot Regeneration (Cannot Be Fixed)
The Canvas REST API **cannot** force-regenerate a quiz snapshot (`quiz_data`) for an already-published quiz. The internal `generate_quiz_data` call only triggers during a `workflow_state` transition to `"available"`. For quizzes with student submissions, Canvas blocks unpublishing entirely, so the "Unpublish → Modify → Republish" workflow fails. The Canvas UI has a dedicated controller for this, but it requires SSO session authentication — Bearer tokens are not accepted.

**Current workaround**: Update questions in-place and log a direct URL so the user can click **"Save It Now"** manually in the Canvas UI.

### Front Page Cannot Be Unpublished
If a page is set as the Canvas course **front page** ("startsida"), the API will reject any update that includes `published: false` with a `BadRequest` error ("Framsidan kan inte avpubliceras"). The sync tool catches this specific error and retries the edit **without** the `published` field, so the page title and body still sync correctly. The `published` state of the front page is left unchanged. This is handled in `PageHandler.sync()`.

### Published Flag Ignored on Module Item Creation
The Canvas API silently **ignores** the `published` field when creating a new module item. You must create the item first, then call `.edit(module_item={'published': True/False})` in a second API call. This is implemented in `BaseHandler.add_to_module()`.

### Date Fields: `None` vs Empty String
- Passing `None` for a date field (e.g., `due_at`) means **"don't change it"** — Canvas keeps the existing value.
- Passing an **empty string** `''` means **"clear the date"**.
- This distinction matters when a user removes a `due_at` from their frontmatter — we must send `''`, not `None`.

### Quiz Detection: Structural, Not Name-Based
Early versions detected quizzes by checking if the filename contained `"Quiz"`. This was brittle. The current approach checks the **JSON structure** (presence of `questions` array and `canvas` metadata block) or the presence of `:::: {.question` blocks in `.qmd` files.

### New Quizzes API (`/api/quiz/v1/`)
The New Quizzes engine uses a **completely separate API** from Classic Quizzes. Key differences and gotchas:

- **`canvasapi` has no support** — all New Quizzes calls must use raw `requests` against `/api/quiz/v1/courses/:id/quizzes`.
- **Payload wrapping is mandatory** — quiz creation/update requires `{"quiz": {...}}`, and item creation requires `{"item": {...}}`. Sending the data directly returns `{"errors":[{"message":"quiz is missing"}]}`.
- **`scoring_algorithm` is required** on every question item. Valid values are **not** obvious from the error messages:
  - `"Equivalence"` for `choice` and `true-false` questions
  - `"AllOrNothing"` for `multi-answer` questions
  - `"None"` for `essay` and `file-upload` questions
  - Using an invalid value (e.g., `"ExactMatch"`) returns an internal Ruby error: `"uninitialized constant Scoring::Algorithms::...::ExactMatch"`.
- **Quizzes are assignment-backed** — creating a New Quiz also creates an Assignment. Module items must use `type: 'Assignment'`, not `type: 'Quiz'`.
- **Time limits are in seconds**, not minutes (unlike Classic Quizzes).
- **The `properties` field** (even if empty `{}`) should be included in item payloads — the official API examples always include it.
- **The Question Name `title` is inside `entry`** — the New Quizzes API returns questions wrapped in an `entry` object, so you must get the title via `item['entry']['title']` when matching existing items (e.g. `item_body` usually doesn't have it).
- **Formulas are NOT evaluated by Canvas server-side** — when creating a Formula question, the API requires `generated_solutions` (an array of pre-computed outputs for randomized inputs). The sync tool must bundle a safe math lexer/parser (`asteval`) to randomly generate these inputs, calculate the result, and upload the fixed datasets. Canvas then blindly picks one of the pre-computed arrays for each student attempt.
- **`scoring_data.value` must be a raw object/array for numeric and formula** — despite Canvas returning a 422 "must be string or boolean" when `scoring_algorithm` is wrong, the correct combination is `scoring_algorithm: "None"` with a raw object (formula) or array (numeric). Sending `json.dumps()` passes API validation but causes the Canvas quiz builder to fail rendering. When in doubt, fetch items from a manually-created quiz via `GET /items` to see the expected format.
- **`scoring_algorithm` values for New Quizzes** — `"Equivalence"` for choice/true-false, `"AllOrNothing"` for multi-answer, `"None"` for essay/file-upload/numeric/formula. Using the wrong algorithm can cause 422 errors or rendering failures in the Canvas quiz builder.
- **Digital Content (Images) in New Quizzes**: New Quizzes (LTI-based) handles file URLs differently than the main Canvas shell. `/preview` URLs for files return an HTML page wrapper, not the raw data, making them unsuitable for `<img>` tags. Use the standard `/download` URL with a `verifier` token for reliable rendering.
- **Stable URL persistence**: Verifier tokens for course files are remarkably stable and typically persist as long as the file exists in that course context. Attempting to strip them or using session-based preview URLs will result in broken images for students.
- **New Quizzes settings must be nested under `quiz_settings`**: The New Quizzes API expects display/behavior settings inside a `quiz_settings` object — sending them at the top level causes Canvas to silently ignore them. Multiple-attempt settings are nested one level deeper in `quiz_settings.multiple_attempts` with fields `multiple_attempts_enabled` (bool), `score_to_keep` (string, **required** when multiple attempts enabled), and optionally `max_attempts` (int, only for finite limits). Time limits need both `has_time_limit: true` and `session_time_limit_in_seconds`. Access codes need both `require_student_access_code: true` and `student_access_code`.
- **`score_to_keep` is mandatory and uses short-form values**: When `multiple_attempts_enabled` is `true`, omitting `score_to_keep` returns a 400 error (`"is not included in the list"`). Valid values are the **short forms**: `highest`, `latest`, `average`, `first`. The prefixed forms (`keep_highest`, etc.) that appear in some documentation are **rejected** by the write API, even though the GET response returns the short forms. The sync tool defaults to `highest` when not specified.
- **Setting name translation between Classic and New Quizzes**: Some settings use different API field names: `one_question_at_a_time` (bool) → `one_at_a_time_type` (enum `"question"`/`"none"`); `cant_go_back` (bool) → `allow_backtracking` (bool, **inverted logic**); `access_code` → `student_access_code`. The sync tool accepts the Classic YAML keys and translates internally, so users don't need to learn engine-specific field names.
- **Assignment-level settings must use the Assignments API**: New Quizzes are assignment-backed, but the New Quizzes API (`/api/quiz/v1/`) does **not** propagate assignment-level properties like `omit_from_final_grade` or `hide_in_gradebook`. These must be applied via a separate `course.get_assignment(id).edit()` call using the standard Canvas Assignments API after the quiz is created or updated.
- **`hide_in_gradebook` has strict Canvas-side constraints**: Canvas validates that (1) `omit_from_final_grade` must also be `true`, and (2) `points_possible` must be 0 or unset. If points are assigned, Canvas rejects the update with `"Hide in gradebook is not included in the list"`. The sync tool auto-enables `omit_from_final_grade` when `hide_in_gradebook` is requested, but the points constraint is enforced server-side.

## Design Decisions

### Why mtime-Based Skipping (Not Content Hashing)
We use the file's **last-modified time** (`os.path.getmtime()`) rather than content hashing to decide whether to re-render and re-sync. This is simpler, faster, and avoids reading + hashing every file on each run. The trade-off: touching a file without changing its content triggers a re-sync, but this is harmless.

### Why Always Run `process_content()` Even When Skipping Render
`process_content()` populates the global `ACTIVE_ASSET_IDS` set, which is used by `prune_orphaned_assets()` at the end of the sync. If we skipped `process_content()` for unchanged files, orphan cleanup would accidentally delete assets that are still in use.
**Crucial for Quizzes:** Quizzes and Subheaders only run Quarto *if* `needs_update` is true. To track their assets we now run `process_content()` manually *before* the skip check and **deliberately discard** the generated HTML. This populates `ACTIVE_ASSET_IDS` without mutating internal dictionaries (which would trigger false updates).

### Sync Map (`.canvas_sync_map.json`) for ID Persistence
We track `local_path → (canvas_id, mtime)` in a JSON file so that:
1. Renaming a file or changing a title still updates the **existing** Canvas object (no duplicates).
2. We can skip unchanged files without querying Canvas.
3. Student submissions and grades are preserved across renames.

**Warning**: Deleting this file forces a fresh sync. If titles have changed since last sync, duplicates may be created.

### Reserved Asset Namespaces (`synced-images`, `synced-files`)
All uploaded images and files go into dedicated Canvas folders. This isolation enables safe **orphan pruning** — we can delete anything in these folders that isn't currently referenced, without risking user-uploaded content in other folders.

### JIT Stubbing for Cross-Links
When content A links to content B (`[see B](../02_Module/01_B.qmd)`), but B hasn't been synced yet, we create a **stub** (empty Page/Assignment) to get a valid Canvas URL. When B is eventually synced, it updates the existing stub via the sync map. This handles circular dependencies gracefully.

### Quarto Temp File Pattern
Rendering uses `_temp_{filename}.qmd` → `quarto render` → extract from `_temp_{filename}.html`. The `_temp_` prefix is checked in `can_handle()` to prevent handlers from recursively processing their own temp files.

### Retry-With-Backoff for File Deletion
When the project lives inside a Dropbox/OneDrive folder, the sync service can lock temp files immediately after creation. `safe_delete_file()` and `safe_delete_dir()` retry up to 5 times with 0.5s delays to handle this.

### Always Fetch Before Create-or-Update
When implementing update logic for any Canvas object, **always try to fetch the existing object** before deciding to create a new one — even if the local file has changed. A common bug pattern: putting the "fetch existing" call inside the "skip if unchanged" branch means that when the file *does* change, the handler thinks no object exists and creates a duplicate. The fetch must happen unconditionally whenever a sync map ID is available.

### Handling Duplicate Items on Canvas
When matching objects like Quiz Questions that don't have UUIDs, map the existing items from Canvas into a dictionary where the `key` is the title/name and the `value` is a **list** of matching items. That way, if multiple identical duplicates already exist on Canvas (e.g. from an aborted sync), you can adopt the first one and comprehensively delete all the remaining extras during cleanup. Simply matching 1-to-1 via dictionary strings will silently ignore extras and leave overlapping duplicates intact.

## Quarto Rendering Gotchas

### Extracting Content from Rendered HTML
Quarto wraps the rendered body in `<main id="quarto-document-content">`. We extract only the inner content to avoid injecting Quarto's full page shell into Canvas. We also strip the `<header id="title-block-header">` to avoid duplicating the title (Canvas provides its own).


### Batch Rendering for QMD Quizzes
QMD quizzes can have many questions, each with markdown and LaTeX. Rendering them individually would invoke Quarto N times. Instead, `_render_qmd_questions()` batches all question/answer content into a **single** temp `.qmd` file using `<div id="qchunk-N">` markers, renders once, then splits the output back into individual pieces. This is a significant performance optimization.

### Query String Mangling
Quarto/Pandoc appends extensions (e.g., `.png`) to URLs missing them. For Canvas links with verifier tokens, this appends the extension to the end of the query string, breaking the token. The sync tool prevents this by inserting the extension directly before the `?` (e.g., `.../download.png?verifier=...`).

## QMD Quiz Format Notes

### Two Answer Styles
- **Checklist** (`- [x]` / `- [ ]`): Best for short text and formula answers. Per-answer comments are indented sub-items.
- **Rich div** (`::: {.answer ...}`): Best for multi-paragraph answers or answers containing images. Per-answer comments use the `comment="..."` attribute.
- **Never mix both styles** in the same question block.

### Indentation Is Optional
Content inside `:::: question` and `::: answer` blocks can be indented for readability. The parser uses `textwrap.dedent`-style logic to strip common leading whitespace.

## Canvas API Tips

- **Search by title is unreliable for exact matching**: `course.get_pages(search_term=title)` returns fuzzy matches. Always iterate results and compare `p.title == title` exactly.
- **Module item ordering**: New items are appended to the end. If order matters, you must move items after creation using the Canvas API's position endpoint.
- **Rate limiting**: The Canvas API has rate limits. The `canvasapi` library handles some retries, but large courses with many assets can still hit limits. Folder caching (`FOLDER_CACHE`) and mtime-skipping help reduce API calls.
- **`quiz_type` default**: If not specified, Canvas creates quizzes as `"practice_quiz"`. Use `quiz_type: assignment` in metadata to make graded quizzes.

## Canvas API Limitations

### Quiz Snapshot Regeneration (Cannot Be Fixed)
The Canvas REST API **cannot** force-regenerate a quiz snapshot (`quiz_data`) for an already-published quiz. The internal `generate_quiz_data` call only triggers during a `workflow_state` transition to `"available"`. For quizzes with student submissions, Canvas blocks unpublishing entirely, so the "Unpublish → Modify → Republish" workflow fails. The Canvas UI has a dedicated controller for this, but it requires SSO session authentication — Bearer tokens are not accepted.

**Current workaround**: Update questions in-place and print a direct URL so the user can click **"Save It Now"** manually in the Canvas UI.

### Front Page Cannot Be Unpublished
If a page is set as the Canvas course **front page** ("startsida"), the API will reject any update that includes `published: false` with a `BadRequest` error ("Framsidan kan inte avpubliceras"). The sync tool catches this specific error and retries the edit **without** the `published` field, so the page title and body still sync correctly. The `published` state of the front page is left unchanged. This is handled in `PageHandler.sync()`.

### Published Flag Ignored on Module Item Creation
The Canvas API silently **ignores** the `published` field when creating a new module item. You must create the item first, then call `.edit(module_item={'published': True/False})` in a second API call. This is implemented in `BaseHandler.add_to_module()`.

### Date Fields: `None` vs Empty String
- Passing `None` for a date field (e.g., `due_at`) means **"don't change it"** — Canvas keeps the existing value.
- Passing an **empty string** `''` means **"clear the date"**.
- This distinction matters when a user removes a `due_at` from their frontmatter — we must send `''`, not `None`.

### Quiz Detection: Structural, Not Name-Based
Early versions detected quizzes by checking if the filename contained `"Quiz"`. This was brittle. The current approach checks the **JSON structure** (presence of `questions` array and `canvas` metadata block) or the presence of `:::: {.question` blocks in `.qmd` files.

### New Quizzes API (`/api/quiz/v1/`)
The New Quizzes engine uses a **completely separate API** from Classic Quizzes. Key differences and gotchas:

- **`canvasapi` has no support** — all New Quizzes calls must use raw `requests` against `/api/quiz/v1/courses/:id/quizzes`.
- **Payload wrapping is mandatory** — quiz creation/update requires `{"quiz": {...}}`, and item creation requires `{"item": {...}}`. Sending the data directly returns `{"errors":[{"message":"quiz is missing"}]}`.
- **`scoring_algorithm` is required** on every question item. Valid values are **not** obvious from the error messages:
  - `"Equivalence"` for `choice` and `true-false` questions
  - `"AllOrNothing"` for `multi-answer` questions
  - `"None"` for `essay` and `file-upload` questions
  - Using an invalid value (e.g., `"ExactMatch"`) returns an internal Ruby error: `"uninitialized constant Scoring::Algorithms::...::ExactMatch"`.
- **Quizzes are assignment-backed** — creating a New Quiz also creates an Assignment. Module items must use `type: 'Assignment'`, not `type: 'Quiz'`.
- **Time limits are in seconds**, not minutes (unlike Classic Quizzes).
- **The `properties` field** (even if empty `{}`) should be included in item payloads — the official API examples always include it.
- **Formulas are NOT evaluated by Canvas server-side** — when creating a Formula question, the API requires `generated_solutions` (an array of pre-computed outputs for randomized inputs). The sync tool must bundle a safe math lexer/parser (`asteval`) to randomly generate these inputs, calculate the result, and upload the fixed datasets. Canvas then blindly picks one of the pre-computed arrays for each student attempt.
- **`scoring_data.value` must be a raw object/array for numeric and formula** — despite Canvas returning a 422 "must be string or boolean" when `scoring_algorithm` is wrong, the correct combination is `scoring_algorithm: "None"` with a raw object (formula) or array (numeric). Sending `json.dumps()` passes API validation but causes the Canvas quiz builder to fail rendering. When in doubt, fetch items from a manually-created quiz via `GET /items` to see the expected format.
- **`scoring_algorithm` values for New Quizzes** — `"Equivalence"` for choice/true-false, `"AllOrNothing"` for multi-answer, `"None"` for essay/file-upload/numeric/formula. Using the wrong algorithm can cause 422 errors or rendering failures in the Canvas quiz builder.

## Design Decisions

### Why mtime-Based Skipping (Not Content Hashing)
We use the file's **last-modified time** (`os.path.getmtime()`) rather than content hashing to decide whether to re-render and re-sync. This is simpler, faster, and avoids reading + hashing every file on each run. The trade-off: touching a file without changing its content triggers a re-sync, but this is harmless.

### Why Always Run `process_content()` Even When Skipping Render
`process_content()` populates the global `ACTIVE_ASSET_IDS` set, which is used by `prune_orphaned_assets()` at the end of the sync. If we skipped `process_content()` for unchanged files, orphan cleanup would accidentally delete assets that are still in use.

### Sync Map (`.canvas_sync_map.json`) for ID Persistence
We track `local_path → (canvas_id, mtime)` in a JSON file so that:
1. Renaming a file or changing a title still updates the **existing** Canvas object (no duplicates).
2. We can skip unchanged files without querying Canvas.
3. Student submissions and grades are preserved across renames.

**Warning**: Deleting this file forces a fresh sync. If titles have changed since last sync, duplicates may be created.

### Reserved Asset Namespaces (`synced-images`, `synced-files`)
All uploaded images and files go into dedicated Canvas folders. This isolation enables safe **orphan pruning** — we can delete anything in these folders that isn't currently referenced, without risking user-uploaded content in other folders.

### JIT Stubbing for Cross-Links
When content A links to content B (`[see B](../02_Module/01_B.qmd)`), but B hasn't been synced yet, we create a **stub** (empty Page/Assignment) to get a valid Canvas URL. When B is eventually synced, it updates the existing stub via the sync map. This handles circular dependencies gracefully.

### Quarto Temp File Pattern
Rendering uses `_temp_{filename}.qmd` → `quarto render` → extract from `_temp_{filename}.html`. The `_temp_` prefix is checked in `can_handle()` to prevent handlers from recursively processing their own temp files.

### Retry-With-Backoff for File Deletion
When the project lives inside a Dropbox/OneDrive folder, the sync service can lock temp files immediately after creation. `safe_delete_file()` and `safe_delete_dir()` retry up to 5 times with 0.5s delays to handle this.

### Always Fetch Before Create-or-Update
When implementing update logic for any Canvas object, **always try to fetch the existing object** before deciding to create a new one — even if the local file has changed. A common bug pattern: putting the "fetch existing" call inside the "skip if unchanged" branch means that when the file *does* change, the handler thinks no object exists and creates a duplicate. The fetch must happen unconditionally whenever a sync map ID is available.

## Quarto Rendering Gotchas

### Extracting Content from Rendered HTML
Quarto wraps the rendered body in `<main id="quarto-document-content">`. We extract only the inner content to avoid injecting Quarto's full page shell into Canvas. We also strip the `<header id="title-block-header">` to avoid duplicating the title (Canvas provides its own).


### Batch Rendering for QMD Quizzes
QMD quizzes can have many questions, each with markdown and LaTeX. Rendering them individually would invoke Quarto N times. Instead, `_render_qmd_questions()` batches all question/answer content into a **single** temp `.qmd` file using `<div id="qchunk-N">` markers, renders once, then splits the output back into individual pieces. This is a significant performance optimization.

## QMD Quiz Format Notes

### Two Answer Styles
- **Checklist** (`- [x]` / `- [ ]`): Best for short text and formula answers. Per-answer comments are indented sub-items.
- **Rich div** (`::: {.answer ...}`): Best for multi-paragraph answers or answers containing images. Per-answer comments use the `comment="..."` attribute.
- **Never mix both styles** in the same question block.

### Indentation Is Optional
Content inside `:::: question` and `::: answer` blocks can be indented for readability. The parser uses `textwrap.dedent`-style logic to strip common leading whitespace.

## Canvas API Tips

- **Search by title is unreliable for exact matching**: `course.get_pages(search_term=title)` returns fuzzy matches. Always iterate results and compare `p.title == title` exactly.
- **Module item ordering**: New items are appended to the end. If order matters, you must move items after creation using the Canvas API's position endpoint.
- **Rate limiting**: The Canvas API has rate limits. The `canvasapi` library handles some retries, but large courses with many assets can still hit limits. Folder caching (`FOLDER_CACHE`) and mtime-skipping help reduce API calls.
- **`quiz_type` default**: If not specified, Canvas creates quizzes as `"practice_quiz"`. Use `quiz_type: assignment` in metadata to make graded quizzes.

# Gotchas

Behaviour that surprises people. Worth a look before touching published quizzes, front
pages, or gradebook settings.

## Silent failures

**No `NN_` prefix means the file is invisible to the sync.** No error, no warning - the
sync simply never looks at it. Same for a module folder without a prefix. This is the
first thing to check when content "didn't appear in Canvas".

**Misspelled settings are ignored.** `publish:` instead of `published:` doesn't fail; the
setting just never applies. The validator catches these.

**Numeric and formula questions on the Classic engine vanish.** `type: quiz` with a
`numeric_question` syncs "successfully" and the question is silently lost. Use
`type: new_quiz`.

**Mixing answer styles drops answers.** A question containing any `::: {.answer}` block
uses div answers, and every `- [x]` checklist answer in that question is discarded.

**Untitled callouts arrive unstyled.** Give every callout a `##` heading as its first
line - see recipes.md.

## Dates and the source of truth

Your files are authoritative. **Removing a date key clears that date in Canvas** rather
than leaving the existing value. If a due date should stay, it must stay in the file.

**Write local time, not a hardcoded offset.** `due_at: "2026-11-17T09:00:00"` means
09:00 to students whatever the season. The two literal forms are traps:

- `+02:00` is wrong for the half of the year Sweden is on `+01:00`, and Canvas will
  faithfully shift the deadline by an hour.
- A fixed `...Z` is a valid instant but not a stable clock time: `09:00Z` shows as
  11:00 local in summer and 10:00 after the clocks change, so a weekly deadline drifts
  mid-semester.

**A bare date is midnight.** `due_at: "2026-08-17"` puts the deadline at 00:00 on the
17th - the start of the day, not the end. Write `"2026-08-17T23:59:00"` instead.
`check_content` warns on `due_at` and `lock_at`, but not `unlock_at`, where midnight is
usually intended.

Two local times are genuinely odd: the hour that never happens when clocks jump
forward, and the hour that happens twice when they go back. Move the time by an hour
rather than leaving it. `check_content` only warns about these when `timezone` is set
in `config.toml` - it runs offline and cannot read the course's Canvas setting.

## Titles and renaming

- Renaming a *file* is safe: the sync tracks Canvas IDs in `.canvas_sync_map.json`, so
  the existing Canvas item is updated rather than duplicated.
- Changing a `title:` is also safe - it renames the existing item.
- **Never delete `.canvas_sync_map.json`.** Without it the tool falls back to matching by
  title, and anything renamed since the last sync becomes a duplicate in Canvas.
- Quiz **question** names are matched the same way. Renaming a question makes the old one
  get deleted and a new one created, which discards its statistics.

## Quizzes with student submissions

Canvas refuses to unpublish a Classic quiz once students have submitted. The sync updates
the questions in place, but Canvas won't regenerate its internal snapshot, so it shows a
**"Save It Now"** banner that the developer must click by hand. Nothing to fix in the
content - just flag it when editing a live quiz.

New Quizzes don't have this problem.

## Front pages can't be unpublished

Once a page is the course front page, Canvas rejects any update carrying
`published: false`. The sync detects this and syncs the content anyway, leaving the
published state alone. Setting `published: false` on the front page simply won't take.

## `hide_in_gradebook` has strict rules

Canvas requires `omit_from_final_grade: true` **and** points to be 0 or unset. The sync
sets `omit_from_final_grade` for you, but it cannot work around the points constraint:
with points assigned it skips the setting, warns, and syncs everything else, so the item
stays visible in the gradebook. Removing the key from a file puts the column back.

On a **New Quiz**, "0 points" includes the questions - a New Quiz is worth whatever its
items add up to, and each question defaults to **1 point** when you don't say otherwise.
A hidden New Quiz therefore needs `points_possible="0"` on every single question, not
just `points: 0` in the frontmatter. `check_content` catches this.

Available on `assignment` and `new_quiz` only.

## Classic quizzes don't take `hide_in_gradebook`

Same 0-points rule as above, and a classic quiz gets its points from its questions -
so qualifying would mean making every question worth 0, which defeats the purpose of a
graded quiz. The key is rejected rather than silently doing nothing.

Use `quiz_type: practice_quiz` instead: practice quizzes and ungraded surveys never
reach the gradebook at all. For a graded classic quiz that shouldn't count,
`omit_from_final_grade` keeps the column but drops it from the final grade.

## New Quizzes are assignments

A New Quiz appears in Canvas as an assignment, not a quiz. It shows in the assignment
list and the gradebook accordingly. This is Canvas's design, not a bug.

## Time limits use different units

Classic counts **minutes**; New Quizzes counts **seconds**. `time_limit: 30` is half an
hour on Classic and thirty seconds on New Quizzes.

## Group assignments can block a sync

`group_assignment: true` without a `group_set` name makes the sync stop and **prompt
interactively** for which group set to use, then write the answer back into the file.
Always set `group_set` explicitly to a group set that already exists in the course.

## Asset cleanup deletes unreferenced files

At the end of a sync, anything in `synced-images` / `synced-files` that no content
references is deleted. Removing the last reference to an image removes it from Canvas.
Files uploaded by hand elsewhere in the course are never touched.

## Quarto renders before Canvas sees anything

Content is rendered by Quarto first, and only the `<main>` body reaches Canvas - no CSS,
no scripts. See recipes.md for what that means in practice.
